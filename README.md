# 8 Puzzle Solver

This is a Python implementation of the 8-puzzle game solver using the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic. The program uses the Pygame library to visualize the solution path.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Run the program using the command `python 8-puzzle-pygame.py`.
2. The program will display the initial state of the puzzle and solve it using the A* search algorithm.
3. The solution path will be visualized using Pygame.
